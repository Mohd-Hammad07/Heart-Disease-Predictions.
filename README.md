# Heart-Disease-Predictions.

**Overview:**
Developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease using various health parameters, involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, and data visualization in Jupyter Notebook.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Gathered and cleaned health-related data, ensuring quality by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to understand feature distributions and relationships, using Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created and selected features to improve model performance, including normalization and encoding.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Used algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest with cross-validation and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model performance with GridSearchCV.
- **Data Visualization:** Developed interactive visualizations with Plotly to present predictions and feature importances.
- **Reporting and Documentation:** Documented the workflow and results in a detailed Jupyter Notebook.
- **Collaboration:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate model findings into business strategies.
